# Proxy Blocked

## What is this?

This is a documentation website for the framework your server uses. 

If you have been directed here by your server, your server does not have a proxy information page setup. 

**Contact your server owner and remind them to setup a link for this page.**

## What is a proxy?

A proxy, or VPN, is a service used to hide your IP address when transmitting network packets across the internet. If you have been directed here, it means that your server does not allow players to connect with a proxy.

Disable your proxy and try again.

## Server Owners

If you are the server owner, you can edit all messages which direct to this URL in your server files.

These files include a link to this page:
* `[dependencies]/px_queue/server/sv_queue_config.lua`

You can also whitelist identifiers, allowing them to use a proxy through your server console. For example:

`queue proxy discord:368480949693841408 1`

This command will whitelist the user with identifier `discord:368480949693841408` to use a proxy.
