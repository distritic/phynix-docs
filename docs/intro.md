# Introduction

**Alas!** This is where you find all the useful information on how to use the Phynix framework.

## Getting Started

First things first, you will need a configured FXServer provided by the Cfx.re/FiveM team. Thankfully, FiveM already offers an amazing guide on how to setup a basic server. You can **[find out more here](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/)**. 

Once you have a server setup and working, visit our **[store](https://store.phynix.gg)** to gain entitlement to the base framework. This is where the magic happens.

After your purchase, check your email for entitlement to a file called `phynix.zip`. Extract this file, and open `README.pdf`. Further installation instructions can be find here.
